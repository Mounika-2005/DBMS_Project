Many people have deemed providing assistance to orphans,  but are unable to do so since they are unaware of the orphanage's needs. This makes individuals visit orphanages in person. But not everyone can do it with their hectic lives today. The ideal platform for those who care about orphans will be provided by this project. We provide orphanages with online donation management so that individuals can donate directly to orphans based on their needs.

We are giving users (donors) from our project a fundamental knowledge of the nearby orphanages and their requirements. Additionally, we offer a variety of donation portals where individuals may donate things like books, clothes, groceries, money, toys, and more. People who want to volunteer at an orphanage can also do so.
